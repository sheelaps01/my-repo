# AI Prompt Projects

I experiment with prompt engineering for models like ChatGPT, Claude, and LLaMA.  
Below are sample sections you can expand:

- **Prompt Library** – snippets for summarization, Q&A, code helpers  
- **Case Studies** – before/after outputs, prompt tuning notes  
- **Tips & Workflows** – chaining, temperature control, iterative design
