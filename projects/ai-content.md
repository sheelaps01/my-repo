# AI Content Creation

How I use AI to generate articles, blogs, and marketing copy:

- **Sample Drafts** – AI-assisted writing vs. edited final
- **Templates** – prompts for blog ideas, headlines, social posts  
- **Workflows** – tools & processes for rapid ideation and polishing
  #AI Workflow Automation#
  Here is a simple automation using Integrately AI. Integrately provide a wide variety of pre-built automation tools.
  I have created a simple automation to notify the team about acronyms check.
  - When a team of writers are working on a project, it becomes easier to have a check whenever there are acronyms to be used. In this automation, The lead writer updates the googlesheet with any new or updated acronyms. This triggers a draft in the leads' mailbox. The lead can review and hit the send button.
  - We can further ehnace this automation by adding chatgpt prompt to add and email template and write a mail and also automatically send the mail to the team every Mondays.
