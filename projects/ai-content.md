# AI Content Creation

How I use AI to generate articles, blogs, and marketing copy:

- **Sample Drafts** – AI-assisted writing vs. edited final
- **Templates** – prompts for blog ideas, headlines, social posts  
- **Workflows** – tools & processes for rapid ideation and polishing
  # AI Workflow Automation Using Integrately #
 # Automation for Acronym checks #
  Here is a simple automation using Integrately AI. Integrately provide a wide variety of pre-built automation tools.
  I have created a simple automation to notify the team about acronyms check.
  - When a team of writers are working on a project, it becomes easier to have a check whenever there are acronyms to be used. In this automation, The lead writer updates the googlesheet with any new or updated acronyms. This triggers a draft in the leads' mailbox. The lead can review and hit the send button.
  # Automation for Release Notes #
  - We can further enhance this automation by adding chatgpt prompt to add and email template and write a mail and also automatically send the mail to the team every Mondays.
  Similarly, you can:
- Create a googlesheet and share it with engineering teams to add release notes content. Set up a trigger (2 days before the release) to send you an aoutomated draft. You can edit the draft and publish it.
- You can have this setup for internal reviews or approvals as well.
  # Release Specific Updates to the team from various meetings #
  - I have faced this problem in most of the projects where as a doc lead I would attend various meetings with the stakeholders. The grooming meetings, 3-amigos, project leads meetings, TAC meetings, TME meetings and so on. Ofcourse, there is AI to summarize every meeting, but I would alway want to pass on only the necessary conversations to my team. I am sure that I can consolidate different meetings and send it as an email summary to my team.
  To summarize, there are many opportunities to summarize many mundane tasks within the team. Automation using tools such as Integrately AI, n8n or make.com provides a way to build the necessary automations.
