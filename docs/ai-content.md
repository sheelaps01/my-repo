# AI Content Creation

How I use AI to generate articles, blogs, and marketing copy:

- **Sample Drafts** – AI-assisted writing vs. edited final
- **Templates** – prompts for blog ideas, headlines, social posts  
- **Workflows** – tools & processes for rapid ideation and polishing
# AI Workflow Automation Using Integrately #
 Here is a simple automation using Integrately AI. Integrately offers a wide variety of pre-built and customizable automations for day-to-day tasks. As a Doc Manager, I have tried to automate a few common challenges using Integrately.
# Automation for Acronym checks #
I have created a simple automation to notify the team about acronym checks. This step becomes extremely important when a team of writers is producing content, as we need everyone to adhere to the standards. Having this simple automation eliminates a lot of overhead for peer reviewers.

In this automation, the lead writer updates the Google Sheet with any new or modified acronyms. This action triggers a draft email in the lead’s mailbox, which they can quickly review and send.

You can see that a draft email is triggered. The lead can then add additional instructions before sending it to the team. This step can also be skipped by triggering an email to the team directly.

  # Automation for Release Notes #
  - We can further enhance this automation by adding a ChatGPT prompt to generate an email template, draft the message, and automatically send it to the team every Monday.
  Similarly, you can:
- Create a Google Sheet and share it with the engineering teams to add release notes content. Set up a trigger (two days before the release) to send you an automated draft, which you can edit and then publish.
- You can set this up for internal reviews or approvals as well
  # Release Specific Updates to the team from various meetings #
  - I have faced this problem in most projects where, as a documentation lead, I attended various meetings with stakeholders — grooming sessions, 3 Amigos, project lead meetings, TAC meetings, TME meetings, and so on. Of course, AI can summarize every meeting, but I always prefer to share only the necessary conversations with my team. I am confident that I can consolidate the key points from different meetings and send them as an email summary to my team.
  To summarize, there are many opportunities to automate mundane tasks within the team. Tools such as Integrately AI, n8n, or Make.com provide effective ways to build the necessary automations.
