# Video Experiments #
Just a few months ago, our team decided to start creating videos for the products we were working on. It took almost a month to write the script, review it with stakeholders, and record the screens. Today, I used InVideo to create a video in just a few seconds — all I had to do was give a prompt, and the AI worked its magic. It fuels our wildest imaginations. For example, I tried prompts such as an underwater library with jellyfish floating around and a dog working in front of a computer on AI content.
With AI-powered tools, it has become effortless to prepare short, engaging videos for technical content and publish them almost instantly — making video creation faster, easier, and more accessible than ever before.
