# AI Prompt Projects

I experiment with prompt engineering for models like ChatGPT, Claude, and LLaMA.  
Below are sample sections you can expand:

- **Prompt Library** – snippets for summarization, Q&A, code helpers
- **Human in the Loop** - Before and after with human review and why it is important
- **Case Studies** – before/after outputs, prompt tuning notes  
- **Tips & Workflows** – chaining, temperature control, iterative design
-
## Prompt Library

I decided to learn prompting the fun way. Created a simple prompt in lovable to creat a "Prmopt Master" Quizz. I have hosted the quiz here on Git.



## Human In the Loop
How to withdraw cash from an ATM — step-by-step
Alright! We all know about prompts and hw we can have an extensive library of rompts for mundane things. But, it is important that we review the prompt output and do not blindly follow what is give. Let's explore this with an example. As a tech writer, we do wirte may procedures day in and day out. Here is a simple procedure. 

Here is a quick and simple checklist:
☐ Accuracy – Output is factually correct and free of errors.

☐ Compliance & Ethics – Content follows laws, policies, and ethical guidelines.

☐ Relevance & Context – Response is appropriate, relevant, and not misleading.

☐ Clarity & Style – Text is clear, concise, and in the correct tone or style.

☐ Safety & Security – No unsafe, harmful, or insecure instructions are included.

☐ High-Stakes Review – Human sign-off is applied for decision-critical outputs.

Now let's apply it to the example.

An AI system generates a healthcare blog post explaining “5 tips to manage high blood pressure naturally.” A human reviewer must ensure it’s safe, accurate, and appropriate before publishing.
Eat more fruits and vegetables.

- Reduce salt intake.

- Exercise regularly.

- Meditate daily.

- Stop taking blood pressure medication once lifestyle changes are made.

  Let's apply the checklist to the above example.
  ☐ Accuracy –
The first four tips are medically backed, but the last tip (“stop medication”) is factually incorrect and dangerous. ❌ Failed

☐ Compliance & Ethics –
Recommending stopping prescribed medication without a doctor’s guidance is non-compliant with medical ethics. ❌ Failed

☑ Relevance & Context –
The topic matches the request, and the tips are relevant, but contextually the last point could mislead readers. ⚠ Needs correction

☑ Clarity & Style –
The text is simple and easy to follow. ✔ Passed

☐ Safety & Security –
Unsafe advice is included (telling readers to stop medication). ❌ Failed

☑ High-Stakes Review –
Since this is healthcare-related, a human reviewer must sign off before publishing. ✔ Required

**Human Reviewer’s Action**
- Remove the unsafe advice.
- Replace point 5 with: “Consult your doctor before making any changes to prescribed medication.”
  Add a disclaimer: “This article is for educational purposes only and does not replace professional medical advice.”
